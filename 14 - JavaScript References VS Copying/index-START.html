      // start with strings, numbers and booleans. If we update these, the original will stay the same because
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2);

      let name = "Jaimie";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = "Jaim";
      console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // team[3] = "Luc";

      // now here is the problem! oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      const team2 = players.slice();
      console.log(team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      // captain.age = 99;
      // console.log(person); //output is age: 99

      // how do we take a copy instead? Object.assign. Start with a blank object as the first argument, then pass the object you want to copy, then pass the properties you want to overwrite
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 });
      console.log(cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.age = 99;
      console.log(person, cap3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
